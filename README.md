- Hi, I’m @terciops  IRL Ken Smith
- I am the designer and developer of the Paladin Solar Diverter and many associated add ons.
- The core Paladin code is in C++ as is the LoRa and ESP32 add-on features.
- Some interesting Windows add ons are in Liberty BASIC Pro - why not?
-  Occam's Kiss and 'One is none, Two is One and Three is a spare' work well.
